    <p class="para">Anime (Japanese:[aɲime] (audio speaker iconlisten)) is hand-drawn and computer animation originating
      from Japan. In Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from the English word animation) describes all
      animated works, regardless of style or origin. However, outside of Japan and in English, anime is colloquial for
      Japanese animation and refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1] Animation produced outside of Japan
      with similar style to Japanese animation is referred to as anime-influenced animation.
